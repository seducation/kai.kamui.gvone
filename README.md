# AI Agent Orchestration & Knowledge Vault 🧠🚀

A powerful, visual, and persistent multi-agent orchestration system built with Flutter. This project implements a **Manus-style** architecture where every agent action is transparently logged, and execution logic is driven by a visual graph.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Visual Node Orchestrator 🎨
- **Blender/Unreal Style Interface**: A 2D canvas for dragging, dropping, and connecting agents.
- **Dynamic Routing**: The execution path is determined by the connections you draw.
- **Typed Ports**: Compile-time and runtime validation of data types (Text, Image, Code, JSON) between agents.
- **Execution Highlighting**: Nodes glow in real-time as agents work (**Blue** = Running, **Green** = Success, **Red** = Error).

### 2. Persistent Knowledge Vault 🗄️
- **File-Based Memory**: Agent outputs are not just kept in RAM; they are saved permanently as Markdown files in `documents/vault/`.
- **Transparency**: Every step taken by an agent is logged to the "System Memory", ensuring offline reuse and data transparency.
- **Offline Capability**: View and reuse previously generated agent insights even without an internet connection.

### 3. Self-Modifying System Agent 🏗️
- **Agentic Architect**: Includes a specialized `SystemAgent` that can modify the execution graph itself based on natural language instructions.
- **Natural Language Control**: Say *"Connect the WebCrawler to the Translator"* and the graph updates automatically.

### 4. Robust & Resilient Core 🛡️
- **Auto-Healing**: The `ControllerAgent` includes retry logic for failed steps.
- **Execution Management**: Advanced modes: `Normal`, `Dry Run` (simulated), `Replay` (re-run history), and `Undo/Redo`.
- **Failure Vault**: Git-like persistence for failed executions, allowing "Redo" with original inputs.
- **State Persistence**: Survival through restarts; the controller saves its runtime state to the vault.

### 5. Intelligent Brain & Planning 🧠
- **PlannerAgent**: Dynamic task routing using **Deterministic** (rule-based) and **Exploratory** (learning) modes.
- **Reliability Tracker**: Monitors agent performance and success rates to optimize task allocation.
- **Capability System**: Fine-grained proficiency scoring for agents (Code, Web, Search, etc.).

### 6. Storage Permissions & Lineage 🧬
- **Hierarchy System**: Organized storage zones (`temporary`, `permanent/vault`, `cache`, `agent-owned`).
- **Access Gate**: Secure, auditable permission system with hash-chained audit logs.
- **Dataset Lineage**: Full audit trail of which datasets trained which models, including version comparison views.

### 7. Adaptive UI 📱💻
- **Responsive Layout**:
  - **Desktop/Tablet**: Full interactive Graph Editor.
  - **Mobile**: Automatically switches to an **Execution Timeline (Feed View)**.
- **Specialized Dashboards**:
  - **Failure Vault UI**: Manage failures and history.
  - **Audit & Lineage UI**: Inspect training history and dataset provenance.
  - **System Health & Sleep**: Real-time biological monitoring.

### 8. Autonomic Nervous System 🩹
- **Heartbeat Loop**: Runs a background pulse every 30s to monitor system health and storage integrity.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically detects and repairs minor file system corruption and storage quota issues.
- **Health Indicators**: Visual monitoring of system state (Healthy, Degraded, Critical).

### 9. Sleep Mode & Optimization 😴
- **Idle Optimization**: The "Brain" enters sleep mode after 5 minutes of user inactivity.
- **Sleep Stages**:
  - **Light Sleep**: Cleans temporary cache and deletes discarded intermediate files.
  - **Deep Sleep**: Compacts execution history and re-indexes the failure vault.
- **Instant Wake**: All background processes yield immediately when the user interacts or sends a request.

### 10. Immune & Reflex Systems (Active Robustness) 🛡️⚡
- **Immune System**: Scans for "pathogens" (failing agents) and tracks system "inflammation" (error spikes). Triggers **Fever Mode** (Safe Mode) to prevent data loss when error rates are high.
- **Reflex System**: Acts as the spinal cord, intercepting dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf`, `sudo`) *before* they reach the Planner, providing instant safety.

- [x] **Immune System**: Active defense against "pathogens" (errors) and system "inflammation" (Safe Mode).
- [x] **Reflex System**: Spinal Cord interception of dangerous inputs before they reach the Brain.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Architecture**:
  - **ControllerAgent**: The central nervous system.
  - **PlannerAgent**: The cognitive frontal lobe for strategic planning.
  - **ReliabilityTracker**: The performance-based hippocampus (memory).
  - **AutonomicSystem**: The involuntary nervous system for health maintenance.
  - **SleepManager**: The circadian management for resource optimization.
  - **ImmuneSystem**: The lymphatic defense system.
  - **ReflexSystem**: The spinal cord for instant safety reactions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Setup API Keys**: Add your OpenAI/Gemini keys in the Settings screen.
2. **Configure Zones**: Set up storage zones in the **Storage Settings**.
3. **Design your Flow**: Open the **Visual Orchestrator** and connect your agents.
4. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on the **System Health** pulse on the dashboard.
